          %span.bold There's a reason we work in 5 day blocks.
          That's just enough time to do one thing really well. And that's the goal of a new startup or product &mdash; to find one thing that customers will pay you for, or pay attention to.

      .row.examples
        .span3.offset1
          %h4.bold We do things like:
          %ul
            %li wireframes
            %li landing pages
            %li working websites
            %li customer interviews

        .span3
          %h4.bold To help you:
          %ul
            %li find your first customer
            %li prepare an investor pitch
            %li bootstrap your business
            %li make your idea even better

      .row.contact-us.large
        %h3.bold 5 days. $10k.
        %p
          We make things simple. A 5 day prototype lasts 5 days and it costs $10,000. You'll work closely with us as we simplify, iterate, and validate your idea with potential customers. At the end, we'll help you outline your path toward profitability and success.
        %p
          Let's build something real.
